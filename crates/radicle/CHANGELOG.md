## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `radicle::node::Handle::announce_refs_for` now allows specifying for which
  namespaces changes should be announced. A corresponding enum variant
  `radicle::node::Command::AnnounceRefsFor` is added.
- `radicle::node::Handle::seeds_for` now allows specifying for which
  namespaces sync status should be reported. A corresponding enum variant
  `radicle::node::Command::SeedsFor` is added.

### Changed

- Re-exports from `git2` at `radicle::git::raw` were limited, using
  the heartwood workspace as a filter. Dependents that require members that
  are not exported anymore will have to depend on `git2` directly.
- Some re-exports from `git-ref-format-core` were moved from `radicle::git`
  to `radicle::fmt`.
- The crate now re-exports `radicle::git::Oid` from a new `radicle-oid` crate,
  in an effort to decrease dependence on `git2` via `radicle-git-ext`. This
  new object identifier type does not implement `Deref` anymore. Use `Into`
  to convert to a `git2::Oid` as necessary.
- Re-exports of `radicle-git-ext` were removed, as this dependency is removed.
  Instead of `radicle_git_ext::Error`, use `git2::Error` (re-exported as
  `radicle::git::raw::Error`) together with the new extension trait
  `radicle::git::raw::ErrorExt`.

### Deprecated

- `radicle::node::Handle::announce_refs` is deprecated in favor of
  `radicle::node::Handle::announce_refs_for`.
- `radicle::node::Handle::seeds` is deprecated in favor of
  `radicle::node::Handle::seeds_for`.

### Removed

### Security

## 0.20.0

### Added

- Introduce a node event for canonical reference updates, `Event::CanonicalRefUpdated`.
  Whenever the node fetches new updates, it checks if canonical references can
  be updated. The node has learned how to return these results and emit them as
  node events. This is a breaking change since it adds a new variant the `Event`
  type.
- Add `#[non_exhaustive]` to `Event` to prevent any further breaking changes
  when adding new variants.

### Changed

- `radicle::profile::Home::socket` defaults to the path `\\.\pipe\radicle-node`
  on Windows. The behavior on Unix-like systems has *not* changed.

### Removed

- `radicle::node::DEFAULT_SOCKET_NAME`, use `radicle::profile::Home::socket`
  instead.
